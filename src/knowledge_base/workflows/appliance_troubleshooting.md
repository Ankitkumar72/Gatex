## 1. Garbage Disposal Not Working
Before calling a plumber:
1.  Check under the sink for the "Reset Button" (Red button on bottom of disposal). Press it.
2.  Use an Allen wrench to manually turn the disposal gears from the bottom hole.
3.  **Safety:** NEVER put hands inside the drain.

## 2. Dishwasher Not Draining
1.  Check/clean the filter at the bottom of the tub.
2.  Ensure the "Air Gap" (silver cylinder on sink) is not clogged.

## 3. Power Outlets
If an outlet in the bathroom or kitchen is dead:
1.  Look for the "GFCI Reset" button (small rectangular button on the outlet face).
2.  Press "Reset" until it clicks.
