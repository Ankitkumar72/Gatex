# Policy: The PropFlow Fair Payment Guarantee
**Document ID:** FIN-TRUST-01

## 1. "Satisfaction First" Model
At PropFlow, we believe you should never pay for incomplete work.
* **No Upfront Deposits:** You are not charged when you book the service.
* **Payment Hold:** We may place a temporary authorization (hold) on your card to verify funds, but this is NOT a charge.

## 2. Release of Funds
Payment is released to the technician only after:
1.  **Completion:** The technician marks the job as "Done" and uploads photo proof.
2.  **Verification:** Our AI (or you) reviews the photo proof.
3.  **Approval:** You have 24 hours to report any issues. If no issues are reported, the payment is processed automatically.

## 3. Direct-to-Pro
* PropFlow facilitates the transaction but does not keep your repair money.
* 100% of the labor/parts fee goes directly to the Service Provider.
* PropFlow only retains a small "Platform Coordination Fee" (if applicable).
