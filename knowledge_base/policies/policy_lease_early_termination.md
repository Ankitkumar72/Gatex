# Policy: Early Lease Termination & Break Clause
**Document ID:** POL-LEASE-05
**Effective Date:** 2025-01-01

## 1. Standard Termination Fee
Tenants wishing to terminate their lease prior to the agreed end date must pay a "Break Fee" equivalent to **2 months of rent**.
* *Example:* If rent is $2,000, the fee is $4,000.

## 2. Notice Period
A mandatory **60-day written notice** is required. The notice period begins on the first day of the *next* rental cycle after the notice is submitted.
* *Note:* Verbal notice to property managers or via the PropFlow chat is NOT valid until a formal "Notice to Vacate" form is digitally signed.

## 3. Exceptions (Penalty-Free)
The Break Fee is waived *only* under these specific conditions (proof required):
* **Military Deployment:** Active duty orders for 90+ days (SCRA protection).
* **Uninhabitable Unit:** If the unit is deemed uninhabitable by a city inspector due to landlord negligence.
* **Domestic Safety:** Documented cases of domestic violence/stalking (requires police report or restraining order).

## 4. Security Deposit Impact
The security deposit cannot be used as the "last month's rent." It will be processed separately within 21 days of move-out, minus any damages and unpaid Break Fees.
