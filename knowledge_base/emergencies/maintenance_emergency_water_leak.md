# Standard Operating Procedure: Major Water Leak Response
**Document ID:** MAINT-001
**Severity:** Critical (Level 1)
**Audience:** Tenants, Property Managers

## 1. Immediate Tenant Actions (The "First 5 Minutes")
If a major leak is detected (burst pipe, flooding, ceiling collapse), the tenant must strictly follow these steps before contacting support:

1.  **Shut Off Water Main:** Locate the main water valve. In most units, this is located under the kitchen sink or in the utility closet next to the water heater. Turn the lever perpendicular to the pipe (OFF position).
2.  **Electrical Safety:** If water is near outlets or appliances, do NOT touch them. Flip the main breaker in the fuse box to "OFF" if safe to do so.
3.  **Containment:** Use buckets or towels to contain spreading water to prevent floor damage.

## 2. Reporting Protocol
After securing safety, report the issue to PropFlow immediately via the emergency line or app.
* **Required Info:** Location of leak, estimated flow rate (drip vs. gush), and current water level.
* **Photos:** Upload 3 photos (Wide angle of room, close up of leak source, floor damage).

## 3. Escalation Logic (For AI Agent)
* **If uncontrolled flooding:** Dispatch "Tier 1 Plumber" immediately. Do not wait for manager approval.
* **If contained drip:** Schedule "Tier 2 Maintenance" within 24 hours.
* **If resulting from tenant negligence (e.g., overflowed tub):** Log incident for security deposit deduction.
